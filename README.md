# RealTimeObjectDetection
This is a Sign Language Detector Model.
I got the idea by watching the Nicholoas Renotte video(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDXdlXlaCco).
As I did not have high end computer device with GPU.I tried it out using the Colab Notebook.
The webcam usage using the colab notebook using the python became quite difficult but we sorted it out at the end.
So here the Whole model and its code for running it in the Final.ipynb file.
